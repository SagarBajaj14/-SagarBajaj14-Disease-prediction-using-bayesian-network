# CausalMed: Causal Disease Prediction with Bayesian Networks
 
The idea of this project is to mimic the decision making of a doctor and develop a model that uses causation instead of correlation to predict diseases of the patients given the symptoms. The dataset used to predict diseases was collected and verified by the doctors of local private hospitals. The bayesian network contains two layers including  symptoms of the patient and diseases that can be a result of the specified symptoms. A website built using flask is used to serve the users, where a user can input mentioned symptoms and a report stating the possible diseases is provided by the model.
